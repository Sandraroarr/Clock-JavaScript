# Clock-JavaScript
Hi, I found a small project where you can practice your Javascript skills (variables and functions).

Our team identified that a nice feature of our customers, is to add a big and traditional clock to our main product, so we have the goal to create it. This clock will have its second, minute and hour object as animated as a traditional ⏲ (non-digital) clock.

Therefore, here we will use:
- JavaScript
- Html
- Css

💚 Take this challenge! 
Nice look!
